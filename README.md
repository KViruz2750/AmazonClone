# AmazonClone
Hello, my name is Karan and using a youtube tutorial on JavaScript, I was able to program a basic Amazon clone with the following languages of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This is a very basic model and could be improved in numerous ways, for example the tracking page could be interactive and the search bar could have been used properly to search items. However, this is a learning experience, being able to understand the languages of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and how they all work together was a great hands activity to complete.
